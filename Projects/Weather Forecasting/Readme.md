In Data Science, weather forecasting is an application of Time Series Forecasting where we use time-series data and algorithms to make forecasts for a given time. If you want to learn how to forecast the weather using your Data Science skills, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through the task of weather forecasting using Python.

Weather Forecasting

Weather forecasting is the task of forecasting weather conditions for a given location and time. With the use of weather data and algorithms, it is possible to predict weather conditions for the next n number of days.

For forecasting weather using Python, we need a dataset containing historical weather data based on a particular location. I found a dataset on Kaggle based on the Daily weather data of New Delhi. We can use this dataset for the task of weather forecasting. You can download the dataset from here.
